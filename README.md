### Inverse design of airfoil with DL methods

## 1. Task description and problem setting.

**Task:** to create airfoil with required aerodynamical characteristics.

**Problem:** there is good XFoil tool for analysis of existing airfoil, but there is no tool, which can *create* arbitrary airfoil by known aerodynamical characteristics.

Foil:

Characteristics:

**So we can get characteristics from foil picture but can not get new foil from required characteristics.**
