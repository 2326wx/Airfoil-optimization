### Inverse design of airfoil with DL methods

## 1. Task description and problem setting.

**Task:** to create airfoil with required aerodynamical characteristics.

**Problem:** there is good XFoil tool for analysis of existing airfoil, but no tool, which can *create* arbitrary airfoil by known aerodynamical characteristics.
